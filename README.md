# Unoffical PHP SDK for Nets
I developed a project where I had to accept credit card paymnets through Nets. I ended up writing a small SDK, and figured it might be a good idea to contribute back and share it with the world. Hopefully this would make it easier to mantain, and easier to get started with in new PHP projects.
